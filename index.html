            <p id="details">Nigel Uno a.k.a. Numbuh 1 is the bald, 
                British leader and head operative of Sector V, 
                keeper of the Book of KND and current Earth representative to the elite Galactic KND. 
                Described as a tactical genius by some and as a paranoid workaholic by others, 
                he has risen to become one of the greatest KND operatives ever. 
                Numbuh 1 takes his position and responsibilities as a KND operative very seriously, 
                often engaging in missions for days at a time without rest.</p>
